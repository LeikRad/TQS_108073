These are extra things that I wanted to try out.

Especially Selenium Grid so I can run the same test on multiple/different browsers without having to copy/paste it several times.
There may be a easier way to do this but I couldn't find it.
It also allows me to do stress tests, so that's useful to know.

To run:
- `docker compose up` to iniate the grid and the 3 nodes
- `cd lab4_1hello_world && mvn test` to run the 3 tests
