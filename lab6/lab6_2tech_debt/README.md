# C) Run the static analysis and discuss the coverage values on the SonarQube dashboard (how many lines are “not covered”? And how many conditions? Are the values good?...)

Lines not covered: 57

Most of the lines not covered are simple setters and the default main method. All conditions of the code are covered. Overall, the values are good.
